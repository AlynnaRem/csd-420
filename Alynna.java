       Assignment: Module 8 Programming Assignment
       Instructions:
           1. Create a class titled <your first name here> ThreeThreads.
               In this class, you are to use three threads to output three types of characters to a text area for display.
                   In the first thread, you are to output random letter characters 
                       such as a, b, c, d â€¦
                   In the second thread, you are to output random number digits 
                       such as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
                   In the third thread, you are to output random characters 
                       such as !, @, #, $, %, &, *
               Display a minimum of 10,000 of each of the three sets.
           2. Write test code that ensures all methods function correctly.
